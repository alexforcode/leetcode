"""
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received
for their ith paper and citations is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.

A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers
have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

Constraints:
    n == citations.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
    citations is sorted in ascending order.
